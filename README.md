# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢 | MyDailyWork Data Science Internship

This project is part of the **MyDailyWork Data Science Internship (June 2025)**. The goal is to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived based on features such as age, gender, class, and fare.

## 📁 Files Included
- `Titanic Survival Prediction Model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing data preprocessing, EDA, and machine learning model.
- `tested.csv`: The dataset used for testing the model.

## 🔍 Project Overview
The Titanic dataset from Kaggle contains information on passengers aboard the Titanic. We built a machine learning model to classify passengers as `Survived` or `Not Survived`.

### ✅ Features Used:
- Passenger Class (`Pclass`)
- Sex (`Sex`)
- Age (`Age`)
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard (`SibSp`)
- Number of parents/children aboard (`Parch`)
- Fare (`Fare`)
- Embarked (`Embarked`)

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Model Summary
We used classification algorithms like:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

Model performance was evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix.
