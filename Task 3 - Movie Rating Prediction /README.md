# 🎬 Movie Rating Prediction using Linear Regression

Welcome to my second task for the **Data Science Internship at [MyDailyWork]
In this project, I built a regression model to predict IMDb ratings of Indian movies using various features such as **genre**, **director**, and **actors**.

---

## 📌 Objective

To develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts movie ratings using **Linear Regression**, providing insights into what factors most influence user ratings.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - IMDb India Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies)
- Contains details like:
  - Movie title
  - Genre
  - Director & actors
  - Runtime
  - Rating (Target)

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## ⚙️ Workflow

### 1. 📊 Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and inconsistent formatting
- Encoded categorical features (Genre, Director, etc.)
- Selected relevant features

### 2. 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized feature distributions
- Correlation heatmaps
- Box plots & pair plots

### 3. 🧪 Model Building
- Applied **Linear Regression** using `scikit-learn`
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained and evaluated model

### 4. 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- **R² Score**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Scatter plot** of actual vs predicted ratings

## ✅ Results

The linear model gave a reasonable estimation of movie ratings. The process helped in understanding how **categorical encoding** and **feature selection** affect regression model performance.
